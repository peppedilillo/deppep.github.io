  <li> <em>Nanosatellites</em> - 
    Much of my work was done in the context of HERMES, a constellation of nanosatellites to monitor cosmic explosions called gamma-ray bursts. 
    Beside software and data, I spend a lot of my time in labs.
    In 2019 I took part to an experimental campaign to qualify GAGG:Ce scintillators for applications in space. 
    Presently I am working on the testing and calibration of the first six HERMES payloads.
  </li> 
  <li> <em>Algorithms</em> - 
    I worked on algorithms for finding gamma-ray bursts in streaming data from high-energy detectors.
    Turns out changepoint detection is the way to go! You can read on Poisson-FOCuS <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01494">here</a>. 
    Beyond astrophysics, it is a fast and powerful technique to detect anomalies in time series of counts.
    To compare performances from different algorithms I wrote a software which simulates detectors, noise and gamma-ray burst called Synthburst.
  </li>
  <li> <em>Data Pipelines</em> - 
    I wrote <a href="https://github.com/peppedilillo/mescal">mescal</a>, a software to tag each photon observed by the HERMES detector with an energy measure. 
    To achieve this, mescal is fed with data collected exposing the detector to multiple radioactive sources. 
    The software throws away noise, associate each data point to a source, does 1 + 1 and outputs tables allowing to energy-tag photons from 
    arbitrary sources.
