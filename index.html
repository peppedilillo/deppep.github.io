<ul class="works">
  <li> <em>Nanosatellites</em> - 
    Much of my work was done in the context of HERMES, a constellation of nanosatellites to monitor cosmic explosions called gamma-ray bursts. 
    Beside software and data, I spend a lot of my time in labs.
    In 2019 I took part to an experimental campaign to qualify GAGG:Ce scintillators for applications in space. 
    Presently I am working on the testing and calibration of the first six HERMES payloads.
  </li> 
  <li> <em>Algorithms</em> - 
    I worked on a new algorithm for gamma-ray bursts detection which is both fast and accurate.
    You can read on FOCuS-Poisson <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01494">here</a>. 
    Beyond astrophysics, it is a powerful technique to detect anomalies in time series of counts.
    To compare performances from different algorithms I made a software which simulates detectors, noise and gamma-ray burst called Synthburst.
  </li>
  <li> <em>Data Pipelines</em> - 
    I wrote mescal, a software to tag each photon observed by the HERMES detector with an energy measure. 
    To achieve this, mescal is fed with data collected exposing the detector to multiple radioactive sources. 
    The software throws away noise, associate each data point to a source, does 1 + 1 and outputs tables allowing to energy-tag photons from 
    arbitrary sources.
